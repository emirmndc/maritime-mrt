# MRT Genesis Logbook

## Purpose

The MRT Genesis Logbook documents the early formation of the MRT open market.

This archive records independent, on-chain buy transactions as liquidity forms organically.  
The objective is transparency — not hype, not price promotion, and not financial advice.

The Genesis Logbook serves as a permanent public record of early market participants.

## Rules

To maintain integrity and transparency, entries must meet the following criteria:

- Only independent wallets (no owner, treasury, or liquidity wallets)
- Only DEX BUY transactions
- Minimum transaction size: $1 USDC
- No manual allocations
- No internal transfers
- No wash trading

All qualifying transactions will be reviewed and archived once per day.

## Genesis Milestones

The Genesis archive is structured in milestones:

Milestones help document the market formation process in a structured way.
