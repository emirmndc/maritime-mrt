# MRT Genesis Logbook

## Purpose

The MRT Genesis Logbook documents the early formation of the MRT open market.

This archive records independent, on-chain buy transactions as liquidity forms organically.  
The objective is transparency — not hype, not price promotion, and not financial advice.

The Genesis Logbook serves as a permanent public record of early market participants.

## Rules

To maintain integrity and transparency, entries must meet the following criteria:

- Only independent wallets (no owner, treasury, or liquidity wallets)
- Only DEX BUY transactions
- Minimum transaction size: $1 USDC
- No manual allocations
- No internal transfers
- No wash trading

All qualifying transactions will be reviewed and archived once per day.

## Genesis Milestones

The Genesis archive is structured in milestones:

- Milestone 1: Genesis 25 (initial market formation)
- Milestone 2: Genesis 100 (extended archive)

Milestones help document the market formation process in a structured way.

## Genesis Phase Structure

The Genesis archive progresses in structured phases.

Phase 1: Genesis 25  
The first 25 independent qualifying entries mark the completion of the initial market formation phase.

Upon completion of Genesis 25, Phase 1 will be considered closed.

Phase 2: Genesis 100  
Phase 2 will be formally opened through an official announcement.  
This phase will extend the archive to the first 100 independent qualifying entries.

Each phase reflects a documented stage in MRT's market development.

## Notes

- Wallet addresses are abbreviated for readability.
- All entries can be independently verified on PolygonScan.
- The Genesis phase will remain open until the first 100 independent entries are recorded.
