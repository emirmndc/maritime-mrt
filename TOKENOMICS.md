# MARITIME (MRT) – Tokenomics & Wallet Roles

## Token Supply
- **Token:** MARITIME (MRT)
- **Network:** Polygon PoS
- **Standard:** ERC-20
- **Total Supply:** 100,000,000 MRT (fixed)

## Initial Allocation (Current Wallet-Based Structure)

| Category | Amount (MRT) | Percentage | Purpose |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Community | 40,000,000 | 40% | Community growth, ecosystem participation, future distribution planning |
| Treasury | 25,000,000 | 25% | Project treasury, operations, partnerships, future development support |
| Owner Hold | 20,000,000 | 20% | Founder/owner allocation (long-term alignment) |
| Liquidity Pool Wallet | 15,000,000 | 15% | DEX liquidity provisioning (e.g., QuickSwap LP operations) |
| Deploy Main Account | 0 | 0% | Deployment account (not used as a long-term holding wallet) |

## Wallet Role Clarification
- **Deploy Main Account:** Used for deployment and setup tasks. Not intended as the main long-term storage wallet.
- **Owner Hold:** Founder allocation wallet. Intended for long-term alignment with the project.
- **Liquidity Pool Wallet:** Used to add/manage DEX liquidity positions.
- **Treasury:** Reserved for project operations and strategic needs.
- **Community:** Reserved for community growth and ecosystem development.

## Holder Concentration Context (Early-Stage Project)
At the early stage of a project, scanners may show concentrated holdings because supply is still held across project wallets before broader market distribution develops.

This does **not** by itself imply malicious behavior. The project aims to improve transparency by:
- publishing wallet roles,
- documenting tokenomics openly,
- clarifying roadmap vs live functionality,
- and improving market metadata visibility.

## Future Improvements (Planned)
- Optional vesting / lock transparency for some allocations
- More detailed treasury reporting format
- Public wallet labeling across ecosystem tools where possible

## Notes
Tokenomics may be refined operationally over time, but fixed total supply and token-level design principles remain unchanged unless explicitly announced.
