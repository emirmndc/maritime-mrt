How to Buy MARITIME (MRT) on Polygon

This guide explains how to purchase MARITIME (MRT) using QuickSwap on the Polygon network.

1. Install a Wallet

Install MetaMask (browser extension or mobile application).

Create a wallet and securely store your seed phrase offline. Never share your seed phrase with anyone.

2. Switch to Polygon Network

Inside MetaMask:

Open the network selector

Select Polygon PoS

If Polygon is not visible, add the Polygon network manually.

3. Add POL for Gas Fees

Transactions on Polygon require a small amount of POL (formerly MATIC) to cover gas fees.

Ensure your wallet holds a small balance of POL before attempting to swap.

4. Obtain USDC on Polygon

Acquire USDC on the Polygon network.

Important: Make sure your USDC is on Polygon, not Ethereum or another chain.

5. Use the Official QuickSwap Pair

Navigate to the official MRT trading pair on QuickSwap.

Only use links provided through official project channels.

6. Swap USDC for MRT

On QuickSwap:

Select USDC as the input token

Select MRT as the output token

Enter the amount

Approve the transaction

Confirm the swap in MetaMask

After confirmation, MRT will appear in your wallet.

7. Verify the Official Contract Address

Before swapping, always verify the token contract address:
